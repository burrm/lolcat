\usage{
unitconversion.square.foot.to.acre(x = 1)

unitconversion.sq.ft.to.ac(x = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Vector - Values in units of square feet}

\value{
x, but converted to acres
}
\description{
Performs a conversion of areas from square feet to acres. Note, per NIST standard, this is a "survey foot"
instead of an "international foot" as is commonly used. In 2022, this will likely become the "international foot."
For most purposes, either survey feet or international feet may be used, but very large areas being calculated will have
an error of roughly a quarter sheet of paper (A4 or letter) per acre (2/1 000 000 difference between survey feet 
and international feet).
